// if needed, or can be removed if all data is managed via JSON files.
// The actual data arrays (servicesData, blogPostsData, projectsData, homepageData)
// have been moved to src/data/*.json files and will be read from there.

// Example: Keeping icon mappings or other non-dynamic data if necessary.
// For this project, types are in lib/types.ts and icons are mapped in components/icon-map.ts
// So this file might become empty or be removed.
// For now, let's leave it, in case any non-CMS utility data was intended here.

export {}; // Ensures this is treated as a module if empty.
